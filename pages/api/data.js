            I started my coding journey in the backend with python and django. I used free resources on Youtube as well as paid courses in Udemy. In the beginning it did not make sense at all, but i stuck with it and did a lot of projects, and soon you realize that there are patterns to this thing.

            If i am tired, i just rest. Simple as that! Well, easy for me to say, i am not employed as a developer, but what if i was employed and i am tired? i think i will still take time off, there is no point in forcing yourself to be in a space where you are not in the vibration for.
            You see, coding for me is a creative space, it's not only a thing i do, it's an opportunity to express myself creatively. I need to be in a space for it first even though it is not always going to be so.

            It doesn’t interest me if the story you’re telling me is true. I
						want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself. I
						want to know if you can see beauty even when it is not pretty every
						day, and if you can source your life from God’s presence.

                        If you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own
						soul. I want to know if you can be faithful, and therefore be
						trustworthy. I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and
						mine, and still stand on the edge of a lake and shout to the silver
						of the full moon.

                        It doesn’t interest me to know where you live or how much money you
						have. I want to know if you can get up after a night of grief and
						despair, weary and bruised to the bone -- and do what needs to be
						done -- for the children.

                        It doesn’t interest me who you are or how you came to be here. I
						want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me --
						and not shrink back. It doesn’t interest me where or what or “with
						whom you have studied”. I want to know what sustains you from the
						inside when all else falls away. I want to know if you can be alone
						with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep - - in the
						empty moments.
